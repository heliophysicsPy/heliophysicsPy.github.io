PyHC serves as a community knowledge base for performing heliophysics research in Python, aiming to provide a variety of tutorials and resources, a list of useful packages, general discussion, and advice. Twice yearly, PyHC meets in person. These meetings are open to anyone, from individuals already utilizing Python heavily in developing open-source heliophysics packages to those who are just getting into using Python and open source development.

**PyHC's first meeting of 2024 will be held remotely on Zoom. The meeting will run Monday, March 11th, 2024 – Thursday, March 14th, 2024, from 9 AM – 11 AM MT each day.** _The Zoom sessions will be recorded._ Expect excellent discussion opportunities, core project updates, and other related talks and demos! See [the full agenda](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FpjjlXckBGXBVSEt9lEClNf_ORbnGOrEzKd5av_cFXY/edit?usp=sharing) for dates/times of the various sessions.
