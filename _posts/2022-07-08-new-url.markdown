We are excited to announce that we have purchased the **pyhc.org** domain. A very special thanks is owed to Pete Riley with Predictive Science Inc. for making the purchase and handling the renewals. At present, pyhc.org redirects to our original heliopython.org. This will remain the case during a transition period until we fully move the website to the new domain, at which time heliopython.org will start redirecting to pyhc.org. Please note that HTTPS support has not yet been added to the new domain, so https://pyhc.org will fail to redirect but http://pyhc.org will succeed. This is only temporary and it is not a security concern because redirects are still sent to the secure https://heliopython.org.
