The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) is thrilled to announce that we were awarded $50k of NSF travel support to provide to selected attendees of the PyHC 2024 summer school! **Per NSF policy, only US citizens and those with lawful permanent resident (LPR) status are eligible for the stipend.**

Travel support applications will be vetted and approved by the summer school planning committee. Applications will be scored on need (whether the travel grant strongly determines their ability to attend onsite), career stage (student, post-doctoral, early career, or within 5 years of most recent degree given preference), and equity (ensuring travel funds are disbursed to multiple institutions, rather than focusing on large cadres from the same institution).

Funding specifications: Once applications have been reviewed, we will award flat-rate travel stipends of $2000 - $2500 (depending on home institute location) to selected attendees. These awards will be sent out as reimbursements for the meeting, therefore the attendee will have to float the cost up to that point.

Apply for the NSF-sponsored travel funding [here](https://forms.gle/iZTQhkWoiA3XB6fW8). **Applications are due by Monday, April 29th, 2024.**
