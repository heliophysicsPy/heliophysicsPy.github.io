PyHC serves as a community knowledge base for performing heliophysics research in Python, aiming to provide a variety of tutorials and resources, a list of useful packages, general discussion, and advice. Twice yearly, PyHC meets in person. These meetings are open to anyone, from individuals already utilizing Python heavily in developing open-source heliophysics packages to those who are just getting into using Python and open source development.

**PyHC's first meeting of 2022 will be held remotely on Zoom. The meeting will run Monday, May 16th, 2022 – Thursday, May 19th, 2022, from 9 AM – 11 AM MT each day.** _The Zoom sessions will be recorded._ We'll hold some tutorial, hackathon sessions, and project update sessions, as well as a couple other discussions that are relevant to the community. See [the full agenda](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J5bex4gwXKg2gAqW-XWx9GftTPlDtH-4JKFOdURCb5s) for dates/times of the various sessions. Note that the agenda is subject to change.
