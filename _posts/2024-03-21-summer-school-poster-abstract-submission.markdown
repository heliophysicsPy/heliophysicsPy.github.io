As a reminder, the Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) 2024 Summer School is set to take place Monday, May 20th to Friday, May 24th at the prestigious Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in scenic Boulder, Colorado, USA and online on Zoom. This year’s Summer School builds on the foundational success of its predecessor, offering an even deeper dive into the rich ecosystem of Heliophysics Python packages. Open to undergraduate and graduate students, early career scientists, and anyone eager to deepen their understanding of Python in the Heliophysics and Space Weather disciplines, this program promises a mix of in-depth tutorials, engaging demos, and hands-on sessions, delivered by some of the field’s leading experts. If you have not yet registered for the summer school, it is free to do so and a link for it can be located on [the summer school's web page](https://pyhc.org/summer-school-24). You'll also find there a link to suggesting housing, NSF travel support applications, specific location, the agenda, and other important information. 

If you plan to attend the PyHC 2024 summer school **on site** in Boulder, CO at LASP, and are interested in presenting on your work within Heliophysics/Space Physics and Python, the summer school poster session is your best bet! Bonus points if you can show work you've done that leverages the PyHC ecosystem. We have created a Google form to which you can submit your abstracts for the poster session, which will help the organizing committee adequately plan for the poster session, and ensure all submissions are on topic. 

[Submit PyHC 2024 summer school poster abstracts here](https://forms.gle/rYV8KFP9moazTxwC8). **Deadline for abstract submission is Monday, May 6th, 2024 at 11:59 PM MT.**
