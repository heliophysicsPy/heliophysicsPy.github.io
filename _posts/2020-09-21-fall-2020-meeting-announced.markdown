PyHC serves as a community knowledge base for performing heliophysics research in Python, aiming to provide a variety of tutorials and resources, a list of useful packages, general discussion, and advice. Twice yearly, PyHC meets in person. These meetings are open to anyone, from individuals already utilizing Python heavily in developing open-source heliophysics packages to those who are just getting into using Python and open source development.

**PyHC's second meeting of 2020 will be held remotely on Zoom over a four-week-long period, starting Monday, October 26th, 2020 and ending Monday, November 16th, 2020.** We'll hold tutorial, hackathon, and unconference sessions, as well as hold a few plenaries during which we'll have presentations on topics relevant to the community. See [the full agenda](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18lrxi8XsjDZ76MjWZPFOovu1JWrdjvoLZmyZfS_LZ3A/edit#gid=0) for exact dates/times of the various sessions.
