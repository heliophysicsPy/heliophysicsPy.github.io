PyHC serves as a community knowledge base for performing heliophysics research in Python, aiming to provide a variety of tutorials, resources, a list of useful packages, general discussion, and advice. Twice yearly, PyHC meets in person. These meetings are open to anyone from individuals already utilizing Python heavily in developing open-source heliophysics packages, as well as those who are just getting into using Python and open source development. 

**PyHC's first meeting of 2020 will be held remotely on Zoom Wednesday, April 29th, 2020 9 AM - 12 PM MT.** We’ll discuss PyHC Project updates as well as plans for the (hopefully) in-person Fall meeting.
The meeting's website can be found [here](http://heliopython.org/meetings/april2020/). **Registration, which is free, but required, can be found [here](https://forms.gle/fYxWXWccyTZxnVUH9).** The meeting's website also has a link to registration, as well as the Zoom telecon information. If you’d like to join our mailing list to learn more information about the meeting and other upcoming events, please see the [PyHC Contact page](http://heliopython.org/contact/) for instructions. We also have a [Riot chat group]( https://riot.im/app/#/room/#heliopython:openastronomy.org
) where we discuss various PyHC issues/topics, as well as discussing other Python-related questions.

**Registration Deadline: COB, Thursday, April 23rd**  
Note: If you already registered and later decide to change your registration (i.e., from in-person to remote), then please email [Julie Barnum](mailto:Julie.Barnum@lasp.colorado.edu) or [Nick Murphy](mailto:namurphy@cfa.harvard.edu).
