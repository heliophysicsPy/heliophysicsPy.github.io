We have a new PyHC logo! Thank you to graphic designer Dayana Gonzalez for her excellent design work, and thank you to all our community members who provided input on it. Follow this [link to a GitHub repo](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/Logo) where you can find the logo in a variety of image formats and resolutions.
