PyHC serves as a community knowledge base for performing heliophysics research in Python, aiming to provide a variety of tutorials and resources, a list of useful packages, general discussion, and advice. Twice yearly, PyHC meets in person. These meetings are open to anyone, from individuals already utilizing Python heavily in developing open-source heliophysics packages to those who are just getting into using Python and open source development.

**PyHC's first meeting of 2021 will be held remotely on Zoom. The meeting will run Monday, May 10th, 2021 - Thursday, May 13th, 2021, from 9 AM - 11 AM MT each day.** _The Zoom sessions will be recorded._ We'll hold tutorial, hackathon, and core project update sessions, as well as a couple other discussions that are relevant to the community.
