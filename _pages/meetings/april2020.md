### Contingency Plans

There is a possibility that additional travel restrictions or workplace closures may occur due to the ongoing spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19.  We will follow guidance from the CDC and the host institution.  If on-site participation becomes inadvisable, then our contingency plan is to hold this meeting remotely instead of in-person. We recommend against purchasing non-refundable plane tickets.
