The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) is excited to announce its inaugural 2022 Summer School, in partnership with the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)! The PyHC Summer School will take place Monday, **30 May 2022 – Friday, 3 June 2022** at ESAC in beautiful Madrid, Spain. There will also be remote participation options for those unable to attend in-person. **This event is free and open to all graduate students, early career scientists, and established scientists looking to transition to Python in the Heliophysics and Space Weather disciplines.** PyHC Summer School attendees will learn Python best practices and receive hands-on instruction from experts as they take a deep dive — via tutorials, demos, and presentations — into the rich ecosystem of Heliophysics Python packages.
