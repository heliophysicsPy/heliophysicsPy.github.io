The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) is excited to announce its inaugural 2022 Summer School, in partnership with the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)! The PyHC Summer School will take place Monday, **30 May 2022 – Friday, 3 June 2022** at ESAC in beautiful Madrid, Spain. There will also be remote participation options (e.g. Zoom) for those unable to attend in-person. The presentations will be recorded and [streamed to YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDKhoNyHGTFZ345-lI-EeC4CAQhNUfUS0). **This event is free** and open to all graduate students, early career scientists, and established scientists looking to transition to Python in the Heliophysics and Space Weather disciplines. PyHC Summer School attendees will learn Python best practices and receive hands-on instruction from experts as they take a deep dive — via tutorials, demos, and presentations — into the rich ecosystem of Heliophysics Python packages.

### Registration
Registration closed on 31 March 2022. You can still watch the [YouTube live streams](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDKhoNyHGTFZ345-lI-EeC4CAQhNUfUS0) if you are interested but missed registration.

<br>

### Dates
30 May 2022 – 3 June 2022

<br>

### Location
Rooms D1-D2, D building<br>
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)<br>
Camino bajo del Castillo, s/n<br>
Urbanización Villafranca del Castillo<br>
Villanueva de la Cañada<br>
E-28692 Madrid, Spain<br>

(and online via Zoom, details TBA)

#### Hotel
We recommend booking a hotel near Plaza de España, as buses will transport attendees from Plaza de España to ESAC each day. A good option is the [Leonardo Hotel Madrid City Center](https://www.leonardo-hotels.es/madrid/leonardo-hotel-madrid-city-center).

#### Bus
Bus pickup will be at 12:30 PM CEST every day from the corner of Calle San Leonardo & Calle Princesa by Plaza de España. The bus to ESAC is free courtesy of ESA; there will be a sign on the bus indicating that it is the ESA-provided transportation. There is also a public bus line which takes 1h30m at most, usually much less: line 623 from Moncloa station. You can pay with your credit card (contactless) in any bus. Otherwise, please have a look at the [Getting to ESAC page](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC/Getting_to_ESAC).

<br>

### COVID-19 Rules
Please check [Spain's travel health website](https://www.spth.gob.es) prior to your trip to ensure you comply with the rules. At the time of this writing, you must be vaccinated within 14–270 days before your arrival. If you do not have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) or EU Equivalent, you should fill out the FCS form on Spain's website. If you need a negative test to return home, [eMed](https://www.emed.com/products/covid-at-home-testkit-six-pack)/[Abbott](https://store.optum.com/shop/products/abbott-binaxNOW-COVID-19-ag-emed-at-home-test-kit-2-pack/?utm_source=united&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=&utm_content=2-pack&utm_campaign=travel_ready_covid_test&utm_nooverride=1) at-home proctored tests may be a good option. You may also find testing at the airport, or your hotel may be able to point you to a testing site, although these aren't guaranteed.

<br>

### Official Language
The official language of the PyHC 2022 Summer School is English. Simultaneous interpretation is not provided. It is therefore expected that attendees are able to communicate in the English language.

<br>

### Python Resources
You do not have to be a Python expert to attend. We will teach important Python best practices, but please use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/python_resources/">Python Resources</a> page to familiarize yourself with the basics if you have no prior experience with Python or Jupyter Notebooks, as those basics will not be taught.

<br>

### Summer School Materials
Looking for notebooks or slides presented at the Summer School? They will be saved in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/summer-school).
