The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) is excited to announce its inaugural 2022 Summer School, in partnership with the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)! The PyHC Summer School will take place Monday, **30 May 2022 – Friday, 3 June 2022** at ESAC in beautiful Madrid, Spain. There will also be remote participation options (e.g. Zoom) for those unable to attend in-person. The presentations will be recorded and streamed to YouTube. **This event is free** and open to all graduate students, early career scientists, and established scientists looking to transition to Python in the Heliophysics and Space Weather disciplines. PyHC Summer School attendees will learn Python best practices and receive hands-on instruction from experts as they take a deep dive — via tutorials, demos, and presentations — into the rich ecosystem of Heliophysics Python packages. 

<br>

### Registration
Registration closed on 31 March 2022.

<br>

### Dates
30 May 2022 – 3 June 2022

<br>

### Location
Rooms D1-D2, D building<br>
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)<br>
Camino bajo del Castillo, s/n<br>
Urbanización Villafranca del Castillo<br>
Villanueva de la Cañada<br>
E-28692 Madrid, Spain<br>

(and online via Zoom, details TBA)

#### Hotel
We recommend booking a hotel near Plaza de España, as buses will transport attendees from Plaza de España to ESAC each day. A good option is the [Leonardo Hotel Madrid City Center](https://www.leonardo-hotels.es/madrid/leonardo-hotel-madrid-city-center). 

#### Bus
Bus pickup will be around 11:30 AM but remains to be agreed (check back here for details). The bus to ESAC is free courtesy of ESA. There is also a public bus line which takes 1h30m at most, usually much less: line 623 from Moncloa station. You can pay with your credit card (contactless) in any bus. Otherwise, please have a look at the [Getting to ESAC page](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC/Getting_to_ESAC).


<br>

### Official Language
The official language of the PyHC 2022 Summer School is English. Simultaneous interpretation is not provided. It is therefore expected that attendees are able to communicate in the English language.

<br>

### Python Resources
You do not have to be a Python expert to attend. We will teach important Python best practices, but please use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/python_resources/">Python Resources</a> page to familiarize yourself with the basics if you have no prior experience with Python or Jupyter Notebooks, as those basics will not be taught.

<br>
