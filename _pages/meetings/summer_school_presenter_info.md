This web page holds information for those presenting at PyHC's 2022 Summer School. 

<br>

### Dates
30 May 2022 – 3 June 2022

<br>

### Location
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)<br>
Camino bajo del Castillo, s/n<br>
Urbanización Villafranca del Castillo<br>
Villanueva de la Cañada<br>
E-28692 Madrid, Spain<br>

(and online)

<br>

### Target Audience
Grad students/early career scientists, as well as established scientists interested in transitioning to Python from another language (e.g. IDL). Emphasis will obviously be on Heliophysicists. Cannot assume a high knowledge of Python.

<br>

### End Goal
Meeting attendees should leave with: 
 1. An understanding of how to use core PyHC packages and other highly-used PyHC packages in research 
 2. An understanding of how our packages could benefit their specific research workflow (don’t need to understand to the same level as main project developers, but enough to follow along)
 3. An ability to write code that follows PyHC standards.
