The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) is excited to announce its 2024 Summer School, set to take place **Monday, May 20th to Friday, May 24th** at the prestigious [Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)](https://goo.gl/maps/mMapAsmgsg7DCrfZ7) in scenic Boulder, Colorado, USA. 

This year's Summer School builds on the foundational success of its predecessor, offering an even deeper dive into the rich ecosystem of Heliophysics Python packages. Open to graduate students, early career scientists, and anyone eager to deepen their understanding of Python in the Heliophysics and Space Weather disciplines, this program promises a mix of in-depth tutorials, engaging demos, and hands-on sessions, delivered by some of the field's leading experts.

Remote options will be available for those unable to make the trip to Boulder. The presentations will also be recorded and [streamed to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@pythoninheliophysicscommun3732). Further, in keeping with PyHC’s commitment to knowledge-sharing, **this year's event remains FREE for all attendees**.

### Dates
20 May 2024 – 24 May 2024

<br>
### Registration
Registration for the PyHC 2024 Summer School is now live. [Click here to sign up](https://forms.gle/cZRyJcjhv2QNVd3UA)! Once again, registration is FREE for all attendees. **The deadline for both in-person and Zoom registration is Monday, April 29th, 2024.** After that date, we will not be able to accommodate additional requests for registration, however, you will still be able to access presentations via the live Zoom recording (not monitored for Q&A by Summer School organizers).

<br>
### NSF Travel Support
The PyHC is thrilled to announce that we were awarded $50k of NSF travel support (award number 2414651) to provide to selected attendees of the PyHC 2024 summer school! **Per NSF policy, only US citizens and those with lawful permanent resident (LPR) status are eligible for the stipend.** 

Travel support applications will be vetted and approved by the summer school planning committee. Applications will be scored on need (whether the travel grant strongly determines their ability to attend onsite), career stage (student, post-doctoral, early career, or within 5 years of most recent degree given preference), and equity (ensuring travel funds are disbursed to multiple institutions, rather than focusing on large cadres from the same institution).

Funding specifications: Once applications have been reviewed, we will award flat-rate travel stipends of $2000 - $2500 (depending on home institute location) to selected attendees. These awards will be sent out as reimbursements for the meeting, therefore the attendee will have to float the cost up to that point.

[Apply for the NSF-sponsored travel funding here](https://forms.gle/iZTQhkWoiA3XB6fW8). **Applications are due by Monday, April 29th, 2024.**

<br>
### Poster Abstract Submissions
If you are attending the PyHC 2024 summer school on site in Boulder, CO at LASP, and are interested in presenting on your work within Heliophysics/Space Physics and Python, the summer school poster session is your best bet! Bonus points if you can show work you've done that leverages the PyHC ecosystem. Please fill out the Google form linked below so that we can adequately plan for the poster session, and ensure all submissions are on topic.

[Submit PyHC 2024 summer school poster abstracts here](https://forms.gle/rYV8KFP9moazTxwC8). **Abstract submissions are due by Monday, May 6th, 2024 at 11:59 PM MT.**

#### Hotel
The official recommended hotel for the PyHC 2024 summer school is the Hyatt Place Boulder/Pearl St, located at 2280 Junction Pl, Boulder, Colorado, United States, 80301 (approx. a five-minute drive to the SPSC building at LASP). We have reserved a block of rooms at the goverment per diem rate ($176/night with 12.5% room tax) for Sunday, May 19th to Saturday, May 25th, 2024. Parking at the hotel is $25/day. **The government rate is only guaranteed prior to the cut-off date of April 19th, 2024. After the cut-off date listed, guestrooms will be released back into the general inventory and will be sold at the prevailing rates.** To book your room for the summer school, [click here](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/colorado/hyatt-place-boulder-pearl-street/denzb?corp_id=G-LAPC).

Please note: all individual reservations that wish to cancel must be canceled 7 days prior to reservation arrival date. Any reservations that are canceled after 7 days will be charged a cancellation fee equal to the amount of room and tax for their first night’s stay.

<br>
### Location
The Summer School will be held in-person at the [**Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)**](https://goo.gl/maps/mMapAsmgsg7DCrfZ7) in the east campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder. Parking passes will be provided and there is free wifi.

### Agenda

#### Zoom Meeting Information
We will use Zoom for remote participation (details TBD).

<br>
#### Transportation
Plan to either rent a car to get from Denver International Aiport (DEN) to Boulder (approx. a 45-minute drive) and around Boulder itself, or, pay for a ride-share service/public transportation. Check out the below links for some options on public transportation. 
* [Getting from DEN to Boulder](https://www.bouldercoloradousa.com/meetings-and-groups/start-planning/meeting-transportation/#driving)
* [Getting around Boulder proper](https://www.bouldercoloradousa.com/meetings-and-groups/start-planning/meeting-transportation/#around)

### Official Language
The official language of the PyHC 2024 Summer School is English. Simultaneous interpretation is not provided. It is therefore expected that attendees are able to communicate in the English language.

<br>
### Python Resources
You do not have to be a Python expert to attend. We will teach important Python best practices, but please use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/python_resources/">Python Resources</a> page to familiarize yourself with the basics if you have no prior experience with Python or Jupyter Notebooks, as those basics will not be taught.

<br>
### Summer School Materials
Looking for notebooks or slides presented at the Summer School? They will be stored in our GitHub repo (TBD).

<br>
### Summer School Code of Conduct
We will follow the PyHC Code of Conduct for the PyHC 2024 Summer School ([see here](https://heliopython.org/docs/code_of_conduct/)). Those who violate the code of conduct are subject to removal from the remainder of summer school activities.
