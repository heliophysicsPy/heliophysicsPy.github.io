### DASH/IHDEA 2024 Meeting

* DASH/IHDEA conference registration + abstract submission now open! 
    * [Meeting website (with links to registration, etc.)](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/ihdea/ihdea-dash-2024)
        * DASH/IHDEA Descriptions:
            * October 14-16: DASH serves as a forum for software developers and scientists to present and discuss algorithms, software, and data systems used in the acquisition, reduction, analysis, and dissemination of data for Heliophysics, including space and ground-based measurements as well as models. After the successful inaugural meeting at John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory mid-October 2023, this meeting will further connect practitioners across institutions, agencies and countries to identify common challenges and opportunities in open source software structure and design, including modern data infrastructure, methods and pipelines. International participation is the key to our community’s success, and all ranges of experience are welcome.
            * October 17-18: The IHDEA meeting will complement this conversation by focusing on the challenges and opportunities in aligning data and data products with community standards, the FAIR principles and general Open Science practices, and the software necessary for accomplishing those goals. The goal of IHDEA is to encourage the use of common standards and services by major data providers, including simulation services and science platforms, in order to enable sharing of data and to enhance science. IHDEA also aims at bridging the gap between different communities such as GNSS and Earth observations communities in the context of a global Heliophysics information architecture.
        * Note that registration is a 2-step process: 1) scientific registration page to log your interest in participating to both or only one of these meetings, your prefered sessions and submit your abstract(s), and 2) page to pay your registration fees and indicate if you would like to use the bus provided by ESA.
    * **Important deadlines**:
        * Abstract submission deadline: 10 August 2024
        * Conference program released: 15 September 2024
        * On-site registration deadline: 15 September 2024
        * Online registration deadline: 07 October 2024

### AGU Fall 2024 Meeting

#### AGU Sessions
* PyHC session: _SM007: Innovative Python Software in Solar and Space Physics_
    * [Submit an abstract to the PyHC session here](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/prelim.cgi/Session/225308)
    * Session description:
        * The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) facilitates scientific discovery through promoting the use and development of sustainable open-source Python software across the solar and space physics community; improving communication and collaboration between disciplines, developers, and users; establishing and maintaining development standards; and fostering interoperability and reproducibility. This session furthers the PyHC effort via encouraging new potential collaborations and increasing awareness of current PyHC software and resources. We invite contributions from Python software packages across the Heliophysics, Space Physics, and space weather communities, including both scientific software and infrastructure projects. Submissions which speak to PyHC’s current focus on software sustainability and interoperability are particularly desired, including submissions that show: 1) new Python packages ideal for integration with PyHC, 2) a focus on interoperability with Python software packages (especially within existing PyHC software), 3) discussion of best practices or improvements in PyHC standards, or 4) integration with cloud-based software.
* **Be sure to submit by 31 July 2024 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT. Abstracts will not be accepted for review after this date.**
