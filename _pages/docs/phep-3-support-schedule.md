TODO.

Per PHEP 3's "How to Teach This" section:
- The PyHC Tech Lead will maintain a new web page on the PyHC website detailing the support policy and include a graphical timeline of the schedule (similar to the Gantt chart above).
 - Automated email reminders will be sent via the PyHC mailing list quarterly and near important drop/support dates to remind package maintainers of the schedule.
