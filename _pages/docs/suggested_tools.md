Listed here are tools that PyHC suggests using to aid Python development. The list was compiled by surveying our members about what they use and by independently examining what's popular in industry.

<br>

### IDE
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables developers to consolidate the different aspects of writing programs. IDEs increase productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging. They offer so many conveniences that we recommend using one.

#### [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
 * The industry standard for a Python IDE; survey after survey shows that more Python developers use PyCharm than any other alternative
 * Dedicated to Python development, boasting "all the Python tools in one place"
 * Made by Jet Brains, the same people behind the popular IntelliJ IDE, and they offer free and professional options
 * More PyHC respondents reported using PyCharm than any other IDE (21%)

#### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
 * A popular IDE for a variety of languages
 * Support for Python is offered through the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
 * Offered as a free product by Microsoft
 * The secondmost popular IDE among PyHC respondents (18%)
 
#### [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org) 
 * 3 (9%)

#### None 
 * 38% of respondents said they do not use an IDE.

### Linter

#### None 
 * 14 (42%)

#### [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) 
 * 9 (26%) (Right up there with Flake8 in industry use)

#### [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) 
 * 6 (18%) (Probably most popular in industry)

#### [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) 
 * 2 (6%)

<br>

### Virtual environment manager 

#### [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)/[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)/[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
 * 18 (53%)

#### [Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) 
 * 4 (now included with Python as of 3.3) (12%)

#### [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) 
 * 3 (9%)

### Anaconda
 * No - 3 (9%)
 * Yes - 31 (92%)(Manage packages/environments, run Jupyter notebooks. Reoccurring sentiment that Anaconda is too much, recommend conda or miniconda instead)

#### None 
 * 11 (32%)

<br>

### Python notebooks

#### [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/#about-notebook) 
 * 26 (76%)(JupyterLab mentioned 4 times)

#### None 
 * 6 (18%)

<br>

### Other tools
Tools that stand out to me:
 * [ColorOracle](https://colororacle.org)
 * [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (over [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com))
 * [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)
 * [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), 
 * coverage (vs [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/)?), 
 * [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org) (optional static type checker)
