**Meeting/Workshops**

* We held our eighth-overall and fifth all-virtual PyHC Spring 2022 meeting. 
    * The meeting took place Monday, May 16th - Thursday, May 19th (on Zoom, from 9 - 11 AM MT). 
    * Presentations included PyHC projects updates (in particular, core projects), project introductions from the HERMES SOC and pysat's pysatMissions, as well as presentations on other PyHC community efforts (the Space Collection and an executable paper that leverages PyHC packages). Additionally, meeting attendees participated in hackathons for several projects, where the goal was to create a Gallery example on integrating a package with at least one other PyHC package. Finally, other relevant community discussions also took place on the final day (future funding opportunities, best practices in the community and future project considerations). 
    * Meeting report to come after the summer school finishes.
* We wrapped up planning for the [Inaugural PyHC 2022 Summer School](https://heliopython.org/summer-school), which kicked off as of today!
    * The Summer school is intended to teach some Python best practices and give attendees hands-on instruction from our package experts as they take a deep dive — via tutorials, demos, and presentations — into the PyHC ecosystem. The event is free and open to all graduate students, early career scientists, and established scientists looking to transition to Python in Heliophysics/Space Weather.
    * The event is taking place in partnership with ESA, from Monday, May 30th, 2022 – Friday, June 3rd, 2022 at ESAC near Madrid, Spain. Around 500 people registered for the event, with about 50 in-person and the rest attending virtually on the Zoom webinar (using the Slack space for communication).
    * All Summer School project Jupyter notebooks are housed in the newly-created summer-school GitHub repo (https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/summer-school).   

**Telecons/Website Updates**
* We continued to hold biweekly telecons as schedules allowed. 
    * Topics included a discussion surrounding a standard way to leverage fundamental space weather data sets, several project introductions—a SOHO ML Ready Data Python Tool, pySINDy, Speasy, psipy, a Panhelio Update, as well as an introduction to the HelioCloud effort, and an overview of the SunPy affiliated package system.
* Several more updates were made to the PyHC website during this quarter, as well. Updates included the following:
    * Projects Page
        * Added Speasy, solo-epd-loader, Solar-MACH, several SunPy affiliated packages, and irispy-lmsal as a new PyHC projects.
        * Updated taxonomy keywords (result of a PyHC spring 2022 meeting hackathon!).
    * Meetings Page
        * Updated the web page for the Summer School event as information firmed up. This is a separate page that is linked to via the Meetings page.
    * Documents
        * Added past quarterly reports that were missing.
