PyHC held a poster session (SH41C - Applications in Python for Solar and Space Physics I Posters) on Thursday, 12 December 2019 at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference. Additionally, we've held three telecons (once per month) since last quarter. In these telecons, we discussed a variety of topics, such as PyHC-relevant information we learned from AGU sessions and posters, transitioning from a LASP-hosted email server to one hosted by Google, creating a job posting for a PyHC developer position, updating the PyHC standards, a standards grading system, the state of certain PyHC projects, upcoming proposal opportunities, and planning for the next meeting. The Spring 2020 meeting will be held April 27-29, 2020 at the Center for Astrophysics. We plan to discuss PyHC Project updates, hold unconferences (based on what the group is interested in), provide some Python tutorials, and discuss our governance structure. All telecon and meeting notes are available on Google Drive, via http://heliopython.org/meetings/.We will continue to hold telecons every few weeks as schedules allow.
