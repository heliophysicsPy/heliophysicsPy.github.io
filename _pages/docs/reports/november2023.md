**Meeting/Workshops**
* No PyHC Fall 2023 meeting - superseded by new DASH/IHDEA joint meeting
* Planned for upcoming PyHC session at AGU 2023 in San Francisco, CA. Poster session. 
* [DASH/IHDEA Inaugural Conference](https://dash.heliophysics.net/2023/)
    * DASH ran October 9-11, followed by the co-located Oct 12-13 International Heliophysics Data Environment Alliance (IHDEA) annual meeting 
    * DASH's goal: 
        * Serve as a forum for scientists and software developers to present and discuss algorithms, software, and data systems used in the acquisition, reduction, analysis, and dissemination of data for Heliophysics, including space and ground-based measurements as well as models
        * Connect practitioners across institutions and encourage international participation 
    * PyHC Lead was a part of the organizing committee for DASH (and presented a poster); PyHC Tech Lead presented in the Computational Notebooks session on "Lessons Learned Publishing the First Executable Paper in Heliophysics"
    * Both PyHC Lead and Tech Lead presented at the IHDEA follow-on meeting to DASH.
    * Travel grant from NSF awarded (PyHC Lead managed this, distributing funds to DASH/IHDEA meeting attendees)
* Planning for the second PyHC 2024 summer school began in earnest (to be help on-site at LASP in Boulder, CO and on Zoom); rough draft schedule created, proposal for student funding to be written to NSF

**Telecons/Website Updates**
* We continued to hold biweekly telecons as schedules (and funding) allowed. 
    * Topics included: Project overviews (pysat and OMMBV, ADAPTIVE project), PHEP process overview and discussion, PyHC-Chat upgrades, SWxSOC updates, and PHEP 1 revisit and readdown.
* PyHC website updates: 
    * Created 2024 summer school page, added in links for spring 2023 meeting to page (for report; later withdrawn due to needed edits), updated members info and pySPEDAS and SpacePy contact info, and changed PyHC riot chat links to element.
