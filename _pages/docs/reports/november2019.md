We held the third PyHC meeting at LASP on November 4-6, 2019. Meeting attendees presented short talks on the recently awarded Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancement grants, and discussed the strategic goals and organization of the PyHC project, as well as how to maintain a diverse and welcoming community. Presentations and notes are available on Google Drive via  http://heliopython.org/meetings/. The next meeting will be held at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA in April 2020. We will also be meeting at the PyHC poster session at the AGU Fall Meeting in December, and we plan to hold telecons every few weeks as upcoming meeting and holiday schedules allow.
