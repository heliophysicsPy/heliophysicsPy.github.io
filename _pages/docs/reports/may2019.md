We held the second PyHC meeting at LASP on May 21-23, 2019. Meeting attendees discussed the organization and governance of the PyHC project, writing a mission statement, a set of strategic goals, and a community code of conduct. These documents are currently being reviewed by the community. A meeting report and a set of governance documents are currently in preparation and will be available through http://heliopython.org/meetings/. We plan to hold another meeting in fall 2019, and continue to hold telecons every other week.

We submitted a proposal for a session at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting.

A grant proposal was submitted to NASA on May 31, 2019 in order to continue this work for another year.
