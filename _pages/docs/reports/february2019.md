The first in-person meeting of the Python in Heliophysics Community was held at LASP in Boulder, Colorado, on November 13-15, 2018. The meeting consisted of a mix of presentations, discussions, and an “unconference,” which allowed attendees to organize a set of discussions based around consensus on topics of interest. A report summarizing the meeting has been produced and is available through http://heliopython.org/meetings/.

We held a well-attended poster session at AGU, and also an informal community lunch meeting. We have continued to hold telecons every two weeks, though the government shutdown caused a pause due to low attendance. Future telecons are being scheduled around topic discussions led by community experts.

Plans for the remaining duration of the project (through June 2019) include:
* Responding to the HDEE call for proposals in the upcoming NASA ROSES release, intended to fund development of heliophysics Python infrastructure and projects which will benefit the community.
* Holding a second in-person meeting in spring 2019, as recommended by the attendees of the first meeting.
* Holding sessions at related conferences, including SHINE and GEM/CEDAR.
