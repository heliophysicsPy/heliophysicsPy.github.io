**Meeting/Workshops**
* We held a virtual PyHC poster session at the hybrid AGU 2021 meeting; our session, "SH35H - Python Applications for Solar and Space Physics iPoster" took place on Wednesday, 15 December 2021, 15:00 - 16:15 CT. Due to difficulties with the hybrid platform, we asked all presenters in this session to present at the first telecon of 2022, as well.
* Results from the PyHC August 2021 Integration Strategy (IS) Workshop were presented on in the "SH44C - Enhancing Heliophysics and Space Weather Research by Improving Information Architecture I eLightning" session, held by Arnaud Masson from ESA and Shing Fung from NASA GSFC
* We began planning for the Inaugural PyHC 2022 Summer School, which was initially suggested at the PyHC August 2021 IS Workshop. 
    * The Summer school is intended to teach some Python best practices and give attendees hands-on instruction from our package experts as they take a deep dive — via tutorials, demos, and presentations — into the PyHC ecosystem. The event is free and open to all graduate students, early career scientists, and established scientists looking to transition to Python in Heliophysics/Space Weather.
    * We're planning the event in partnership with ESAC (namely, with Arnaud Masson), and will hold the Summer School—to take place 30 May 2022 - 3 June 2022—at ESAC, near Madrid, Spain. We intend to have remote participation options as well.
    * We put together a Summer School web page on the PyHC website (https://heliopython.org/summer-school).
* We began planning for the eight overall, and fifth all-virtual, PyHC Spring 2022 Meeting.
    * The meeting will take place 16 May 2022 - 19 May 2022 on the Zoom platform, from 9-11 AM MT each day. 
    * We again are placing a big emphasis on project integration and interoperability, asking core and highly used projects to work together to come up with hackathon ideas that follow this spirit. We will also have core project updates, some HDEE updates, and other relevant presentations/discussions.   

**Outreach/Publications**
* We created a PyHC Helionauts group (https://helionauts.org/), and are encouraging participants to join that group. Helionauts has the advantage of circumventing the problems chat rooms like our current Element chat group have, which is that they are "synchronous, ephemeral, and do not scale easily to an entire scientific community". 
* We created a PyHC Twitter account (https://twitter.com/PyHC_official). Twitter is a highly-used platform in academia, and serves as a great way to connect PyHC with scientists in the Heliophysics and Space Weather domains. 
* Julie Barnum submitted a manuscript, "Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC): current status and future outlook"— which covers the current state of PyHC as a Heliophysics framework, and future directions for the community—to the Advances in Space Research Special Issue: COSPAR Space Weather Roadmap 2022 Research and Applications.
* Shawn Polson is working on an executable paper that links together several PyHC packages to detect magnetopause locations and compare them to magnetopause models. To potentially be submitted to the Frontiers Special Issue: Snakes on a Spaceship—An Overview of Python in Space Physics.   

**Telecons/Website Updates**
* We continued to hold biweekly telecons as schedules allowed (we took a break from all telecons in December 2021 due to various meeting and holiday conflicts). ​Topics included an overview of presentations by poster presenters at the PyHC AGU 2021 poster session, a discussion of the future of the PyHC Gallery page and how Jupyter Book could help, and HDEE project wrap ups and intros.
* Several more updates were made to the PyHC website during this quarter, as well. Updates included the following:  
    * Acknowledgements page 
        * Added the new PyHC's grant NASA award number.
    * Projects Page 
        * Updated OMMBV project information
        * Added dbprocessing as a new project
    * Meetings Page
        * Created a web page for the Summer School event (including info about the summer school, and links to another new page on Python resources). This is a separate page that is linked to via the Meetings page. 
    * Blogs
        * Added blogs announcing the Summer School and the Spring 2022 Meeting.
    * Documents
        * Created a new Python Resources web page (linked to on the Summer School web page), and linked it to the Documents page.
    * General
        * Updated the website to properly show image cards when someone tweets anything linked to the PyHC website.
