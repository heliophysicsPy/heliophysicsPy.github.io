**Meetings/Workshops** 
* Held the PyHC spring 2023 meeting, which was our first hybrid meeting since Fall 2019.
    * Held Tuesday, May 16th - Thursday, May 18th in-person at LASP as well as online on Zoom. 
    * Topics covered: several core project updates, updates and intros from other PyHC projects, many discussion sessions (executable paper future directions, geomagnetic field models within heliophysics, chatGPT, pyOpenSci and its connections with PyHC, PyHC's involvement in the upcoming TESS 2024 meeting), tutorials (HelioCloud, geomagnetic datacubes, PyHC package submission, clean code), hackathons (one big accomplishment from this was that one group created the first Python virtual environment that has every PyHC package installed!), and unconferences. All sessions were recorded, save for unconferences (we discussed important topics to the community, such as running things in the cloud, maintainer burnout, etc.).
    * The meeting was well-attended, with around 20-30 on Zoom each day, and around 15 people in-person.
* The PyHC Fall 2023 AGU session abstract was accepted!
    * Session conveners: Julie Barnum, Shawn Polson, Angeline Burrell, Arnaud Masson
    * [Session SH012: Implementations in Python for Solar and Space Physics](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/189609)
    * Applied for talks, but format is TBD dependent on AGU decision.
    * Now accepting abstracts!
* Initial steps taken towards planning the PyHC 2024 summer school.
