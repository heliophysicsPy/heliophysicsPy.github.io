**Meetings/Workshops**
* Began planning for the second hybrid PyHC Fall meeting since the pandemic lifted.
    * To be held Monday, Nov 11th - Wednesday, Nov 13th (on Zoom and in-person at LASP).
    * Meeting content will follow past PyHC biannual meetings, with a combination of presentations, discussion sessions, and hackathon sessions. Lots of emphasis this time to be placed on PHEPs and PyHC governance structure. [Meeting web page here](https://pyhc.org/meetings/fall2024/).
* The PyHC session abstract, submitted to the [Fall 2024 AGU meeting](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting), was accepted.
    * Session Title: Innovative Python Software in Solar and Space Physics
    * Session format: Poster
    * Total abstracts received: 11
* The PyHC Lead attended in-person and presented at both CEDAR 2024 and the COSPAR 2024 meeting.

**Telecons/Website Updates** 
* We continued to hold biweekly telecons as schedules allowed.
    * Topics included a [PHEP 3](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/pull/29) discussion (PyHC Python & Upstream Package Support Policy), a vote on [PHEP 2](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/pull/25) (outlining PHEP templates; passed first vote!), an overview of the new HelioData system, and a presentation on building tools to analyze FAIR for HDRL datasets.
* Several more updates were made to the PyHC website during this quarter, as well:
    * Updating package metadata (PlasmaPy, solarmach, solo-epd-loader), adding info for AGU and DASH/IHDEA sessions, new packages added (amisrsynthdata, PyAuroraX), and a creation of the PyHC Fall 2024 meeting page.
* Funding
    * Proposals to NASA HDRL (Technical Officer: Dr. Brian Thomas) for continued PyHC leadership support and DASH/IHDEA 2024 meeting travel support
