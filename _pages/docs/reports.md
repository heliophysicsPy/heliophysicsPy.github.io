Heliophysics Python project status, October 19, 2018

The contract was signed as of June 19. We publicized the project at TESS, Planetary Science Informatics & Data Analytics, and COSPAR. A kickoff meeting was held at TESS to gauge community interest and establish a direction for the project. Since then, we have held telecons every other week, organized an AGU session, and determined the need for an in-person meeting for the community. This meeting is planned for November 13-15 at LASP. At present we have 17 registered attendees.

A mailing list was established to facilitate communication and send out meeting notices. The mailing list currently has 107 subscribers worldwide. We have also used the heliopython.org website to post information about software packages and upcoming meetings, as well as posting archives from the mailing list.

Plans for the remaining duration of the project (through June 2019) include:
* Holding the working group meeting in November 2018, including planning for future meetings
* Writing a report summarizing the recommendations from the working group meeting
* A poster session at AGU
* Evaluating need for additional in-person meetings, meeting cadence, and the possibility of combining with conferences (e.g. CEDAR)

Heliophysics Python project status, February 14, 2019

The first in-person meeting of the Python in Heliophysics Community was held at LASP in Boulder, Colorado, on November 13-15, 2018. The meeting consisted of a mix of presentations, discussions, and an “unconference,” which allowed attendees to organize a set of discussions based around consensus on topics of interest. A report summarizing the meeting has been produced and is available through http://heliopython.org/meetings/.

We held a well-attended poster session at AGU, and also an informal community lunch meeting. We have continued to hold telecons every two weeks, though the government shutdown caused a pause due to low attendance. Future telecons are being scheduled around topic discussions led by community experts.

Plans for the remaining duration of the project (through June 2019) include:
* Responding to the HDEE call for proposals in the upcoming NASA ROSES release, intended to fund development of heliophysics Python infrastructure and projects which will benefit the community.
* Holding a second in-person meeting in spring 2019, as recommended by the attendees of the first meeting.
* Holding sessions at related conferences, including SHINE and GEM/CEDAR.

Heliophysics Python project status, May 31, 2019

We held the second PyHC meeting at LASP on May 21-23, 2019. Meeting attendees discussed the organization and governance of the PyHC project, writing a mission statement, a set of strategic goals, and a community code of conduct. These documents are currently being reviewed by the community. A meeting report and a set of governance documents are currently in preparation and will be available through http://heliopython.org/meetings/. We plan to hold another meeting in fall 2019, and continue to hold telecons every other week.

We submitted a proposal for a session at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting.

A grant proposal was submitted to NASA on May 31, 2019 in order to continue this work for another year.

PyHC project status, November 2019

We held the third PyHC meeting at LASP on November 4-6, 2019. Meeting attendees presented short talks on the recently awarded Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancement grants, and discussed the strategic goals and organization of the PyHC project, as well as how to maintain a diverse and welcoming community. Presentations and notes are available on Google Drive via  http://heliopython.org/meetings/. The next meeting will be held at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA in April 2020. We will also be meeting at the PyHC poster session at the AGU Fall Meeting in December, and we plan to hold telecons every few weeks as upcoming meeting and holiday schedules allow.

PyHC project status, February 2020

PyHC held a poster session (SH41C - Applications in Python for Solar and Space Physics I Posters) on Thursday, 12 December 2019 at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference. Additionally, we've held three telecons (once per month) since last quarter. In these telecons, we discussed a variety of topics, such as PyHC-relevant information we learned from AGU sessions and posters, transitioning from a LASP-hosted email server to one hosted by Google, creating a job posting for a PyHC developer position, updating the PyHC standards, a standards grading system, the state of certain PyHC projects, upcoming proposal opportunities, and planning for the next meeting. The Spring 2020 meeting will be held April 27-29, 2020 at the Center for Astrophysics. We plan to discuss PyHC Project updates, hold unconferences (based on what the group is interested in), provide some Python tutorials, and discuss our governance structure. All telecon and meeting notes are available on Google Drive, via http://heliopython.org/meetings/.We will continue to hold telecons every few weeks as schedules allow.

PyHC project status, May 2020

We held the fourth, and first completely virtual, PyHC meeting on Wednesday, April 29th. Meeting attendees presented short talks on the recently awarded Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancement (HDEE) grants, as well as a couple other PyHC projects, and we had a “meet and greet” with the new PyHC Developer hire, Tom Baltzer. Following the meeting, Eric Grimes gave a webinar geared towards Python developers who’re creating scientific software. Presentations and notes are available on Google Drive via http://heliopython.org/meetings/. The next meeting will be held sometime in the fall, and may be completely virtual again, depending on the COVID-19 situation. In addition to the spring 2020 meeting, we held four telecons since last quarter. Topics included planning for the spring 2020 meeting, an overview of the SPASE registry and its application to PyHC, software preservation, as well as some project updates. We plan to hold telecons on an approximately biweekly basis, as schedules allow.

PyHC project status, August 2020

This quarterly progress report wraps up the above-mentioned grant for PyHC. We submitted a new grant to continue to the efforts of this grant, which was accepted and began in mid-August 2020. During the last quarter of this grant, we submitted a PyHC session proposal (titled "Python Application Development for Solar and Space Physics) to the virtual AGU 2020 meeting. This session proposal was accepted, and we had 11 abstract submissions to the session, two of which are student-led abstracts. We also began planning for the virtual Fall 2020 PyHC meeting, which will take on a different format from the virtual Spring 2020 PyHC meeting; we plan to spread out the meeting over an approximately month-long period in lieu of spending a few consecutive, long days on Zoom. The Monday of each week will have a normal, hour-long telecon, during which we have open slots for presentations, time for wrapping up from the previous meeting session, etc. Each week will also have an extra, three-hour long session dedicated to hackathons, tutorials, or unconferences. Next, we've continued to hold telecons on an approximately bi-weekly schedule. Topics have included SunPy and SpacePy package updates, Python type checking, upcoming abstract submission opportunities, drafts of a PyHC logo, and Fall meeting planning. Finally, our PyHC-dedicated developer, Tom Baltzer, left LASP for a position at a different company. We filled the open PyHC Technical Lead position with a new-hire to the LASP web team, Shawn Polson. 8

PyHC project status, November 2020

We held the fifth, and second fully-virtual, PyHC meeting over a four-week long period, starting Monday October 26th, and ending Monday, November 16th. During this time frame we held three plenary sessions, which covered a couple project updates, as well as a more in-depth discussion about PyHC's structure and funding. We also hosted hackathon, tutorial, and unconference sessions (one each Thursday of the four-week meeting period). Although this spread-out format allowed more time for discussion, as a group we agreed that a more condensed format would be desirable for the spring 2021 virtual meeting. As an example, we'd like a meeting schedule more akin to IHDEA's 2020 meeting. The spring 2021 meeting will occur sometime mid-to-late April. Exact dates will be decided via a poll sent to the PyHC community after the holidays. Presentations and notes from the fall 2020 meeting are available on Google Drive via https://heliopython.org/meetings/. Lastly for meetings, we will host a PyHC poster session at the virtual AGU 2020 meeting on December 8th. Poster authors have been given the option to choose an hour or two time frame that they'll be available for comments, questions, etc.

We continued to hold biweekly telecons up until the fall 2020 meeting. These included discussions around an official PyHC logo (a final version was accepted mid October), fall 2020 meeting planning, and presentations and discussions about reproducible software environments and the Humboldt project. We will pick up the telecon schedule again after the holidays. Several updates were made to the PyHC website during the quarter. A new web page was created for the PyHC fall 2020 meeting. The People page was updated to include current PyHC members, the Project page was updated to fix broken package logo URLs, include package column sorting, and include SpacePy in the core packages, and the Blog page was updated to incorporate pagination. Finally, the PyHC website is now served over https, several packages submitted self-evaluations (which were reviewed and approved), and the PyHC logo was put to use on the website.
